# EXPENSES LIST with REACT

## Downloading code snapshots

You can download all the content of a branch via the "Code" button here on Github. You can then either [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository or simply download the selected branch content as a ZIP file.

## Available Scripts

To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the `cd` command in your command prompt or terminal first.

Then you can run the following command to install all required dependencies (this will create a `/node_modules` folder):

#### `npm install` 

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**Important:** If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys.
